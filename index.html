              <h3 style="color: black; text-align: center;">Birthday Paradox Simulator</h3>
              <p>
              <h3>What Is The Birthday Paradox?</h3>
              The birthday paradox is a probability puzzle stating that in a
              group of just 23 people, there's a greater than 50%
              chance that two people share the same birthday
              </p>
              <p>
              <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
              The program works by creating a list of randomly generated birthdays.
              It then creates experiments where we test to see if there are any duplicate birthdays
              in this list, we test a new batch of birthdays 20 times per experiment. the experiments increase the list
              of birthdays by five birthdays everytime we run them.
              the experiments start at 5 and end at 100. the program prints out the number of birthdays we are
              testing and the percent chance of duplicate birthdays found next to it
              </p>
              <p>
              <h3>Implementation</h3>
              I worked on creating the Trial Class, which would create a list of birthdays,
              and the Experiment Class, which would test the list for duplicate for birthdays 20 times per list.
              As well as the Simulator Class, which was essentially just a driver class.
              Implementing these three classes required working together with my partner and his Birthday class,
              which would generate a random birthday. Creating the Tests for these files and my partner's Birthday
              class was also my responsibility. I tried hard to stick to the SOLID Principles of OOP, and it shows in
              The classes and methods I created.

              </p>
              <p>
              <h3>What I Learned</h3>
              This Project, was the first time where I had to think and program using the SOLID Principles of OOP.
              Working on this project solidified my experience creating classes and methods that followed the SOLID
              Principles

              </p>
              <p>Additionally, this is my first time Implementing Test Classes and is my first look into Test-Driven
                Development

              </p>
              <p>Lastly, This is the first project where I had to work with a partner Using GitHub. Creating seperate
                branches
                and creating pull-requests was very exciting and very informative. I had to learn how to create good
                commit messages
                and create informative descriptions for my pull-requests, while also doing code reviews for my partner!
              </p>

                  <h3 style="color: black; text-align: center;">Elevator Simulator</h3>
                  <p>
                  <h3>What Is The Elevator Simulator?</h3>
                  The Elevator Simulator is exactly that; A program that simulates 
                  Elevators moving up and down buildings, doing their normal operations
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <h3>What Does It Do?</h3>
                  This program will create a specified amount of 4 types of elevators: Standard Elevator, 
                  which will pick up calls and people if they are on the way to an already assigned call.
                  Express Elevator, which will only service the top half of the building and the ground floor. Freight Elevator, which 
                  can service every floor, but will not take a new call unless it is empty
                  and will not cause it to have more than one person at a time. And Penthouse Elevator, which will only service calls 
                  going to and from the top floor and the ground floor
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  A Scheduler would be selected to assign calls to these Elevators. Theres the Simple and Complex Schedulers. 
                  The Simple Scheduler would assign calls from left to right depending on if the elevator is available to take the call.
                  The Complex Scheduler would check to see which Elevator is closest and available, and assign it that call.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Together, the Elevators and Schedulers make a functioning Simulation
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                    The program would accept 7 arguments: Number of floors, Type of Scheduler, Number of Standard Elevators, Number of Freight Elevators, 
                    Number of Penthouse Elevators, Number of Express Elevators, And the file of calls to read from.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once all the Elevators are created, the Scheduler would go Round by Round until all calls are assigned and completed and all Elevators are grounded
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Round is when a scheduler attempts to assign a call to an Elevator, and all Elevators move. Elevators move one floor at a time
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Elevators can accept calls depending on what kind of Elevator they are and what their limits are.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Calls have a pickup and a drop off location and are mae by one person at a time in this simulator.
                    one call corresponds to one person
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The program prints out what round its on, The Elevators, their current floor, direction, and people onboard, the calls assigned to that Elevator,
                    and the calls yet to be assigned
                  </p>
                
                  <p>
                    <h3>Design of the project</h3>
                    We designed the project to be as comliant to the SOLID principles as possible. This helped with readability and the Modular design
                    made debugging easier

                    <P>
                      We designed the many Elevators to be Classes that extended an Abstract Elevator Class, which held information such as current floor, number of people,
                      direction, and assigned call. This abstract method also had every method related to moving and changing the direction of the Elevator as well as keeping track
                      of people on board. the Only abstract method we had was canServiceCall(), which would be defined differently based on the elevators specifications
                    </P>
                    <p>
                      We designed both Schedulers to Implement a Scheduler Interface, that declared important methods that would be used by both kinds of Scheduler, but be defined differently in each.
                      The independant Schedulers also implemented helpers that would be useful in assigning calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We also designed Calls to be its own class, where each call would be its own object that held its information such as pickup floor, drop off floor, and its status. 
                      This helped immensly in keeping code legible and easy to implement. We originally used a List Array of integers, which proved difficult to keep track of.
                      This implementation of Call objects proved to be quite effective here.
                    </p>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <h3>Implementation</h3>
                  I worked on implementing the logic for each Elevator and making sure they passed all testing. I also design, implemented, and tested 
                  The Complex Scheduler. Once we designed the Calls class, I was in charge of refactoring all the previous code and handled the debugging
            
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                  For this Project, Test-Driven Development took center stage and allowed us to make solid and steady progress.
                  We got lots of hands-on experience dealing with Abstraction and Inheritence as well as puttin our SOLID principles into practice to make legible code thats
                  easy to follow, and make changes to.
            
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, This project gave me extensive practice using a git repository. Specfically with branching, code reviews, and pull-requests
                    This project also gave me plenty of experience dealing with Merge conflicts and how to resolve them
                  </p>
